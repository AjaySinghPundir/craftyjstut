# Welcome to starmelt's Crafty Tutorials!

CraftyJS is a nice litte JavaScript Game Engine, you can get at [[http://craftyjs.com]].

Currently there is some documented Source Code for you to get started with CraftyJS.
- Go to the 'firststeps' directory for the basics.
- In 'samegame' you will find an (almost) complete puzzle game. In case you don't know that game, there is a Wikipedia entry for it: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame]].

I will add more explanations to the Wiki and create more examples.

So it might be worth coming back later. :)


Now, have fun!
Let me know what you think about these tutorials, all feedback is welcome!

Thanks,
